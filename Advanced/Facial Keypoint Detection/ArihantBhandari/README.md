### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to predict 15 essential facial key-points like center of eyes, edge-points of eyebrows and so on by using images.

### 🧮 **Methodology Followed**

To achieve our goals, the following steps were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized to the range 0 to 1.

- Labels were used to lock onto features for each image.

- Features have been normalized using a MinMaxScaler.

- Images were resized to a fixed size of 96X96 pixels.

- Custom and pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 📈 **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

#### Metrics: 

We used Validation and Test **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as metrics.

| Models | Validation MSE | Validation MAE | Test MSE | Test MAE |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| ResNet-50 | 0.0022 | 0.0221 | 0.0020 | 0.0218 |
| InceptionV3 | 0.0023  | 0.0277 | 0.0021 | 0.0273 | 
| CNN | 0.0015 | 0.0213 | 0.0013 | 0.0214 |
| VGG16 | 0.0022 | 0.0262 | 0.0019 | 0.0253 |
| MobileNet | 0.0023 | 0.0278 | 0.0022 | 0.0280 |
| DenseNet-121 | 0.0019 | 0.0245 | 0.0017 | 0.0240 |
| Xception | 0.0019 | 0.0240 | 0.0018 | 0.0239 |

### 📢 **Conclusion**

We conclude the following:

All models work well on the task; **CNN**, **DenseNet-121**, **Xception**, **VGG-16** and **Resnet-50** are ideal for this.
